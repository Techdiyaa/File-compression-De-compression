Title: "The Enchanted Forest"

Once upon a time in a small village nestled at the edge of an enchanted forest, there lived a curious young girl named Alice. She had heard tales of the mystical wonders that lay hidden deep within the dense woods, and her heart was filled with an insatiable thirst for adventure.

One bright and sunny morning, Alice decided to embark on a journey into the heart of the enchanted forest. She packed a small satchel with some essentials and set off on her quest, her eyes sparkling with excitement. As she ventured deeper into the woods, the trees seemed to whisper secrets, and the air was filled with an ethereal quality that tingled her senses.

After a few hours of wandering through the enchanting woods, Alice stumbled upon a meadow bathed in golden sunlight. The meadow was adorned with a carpet of vibrant wildflowers, their colors a mesmerizing symphony. It was there that she encountered a magical creature, a graceful unicorn with a coat as white as freshly fallen snow.

The unicorn, whose name was Luna, possessed the ability to speak. She told Alice of the forest's ancient secrets, of hidden treasures, and of the importance of preserving the delicate balance between magic and nature. Luna became Alice's guide and protector on her enchanting journey.

As days turned into weeks, Alice and Luna explored the depths of the forest. They discovered ancient ruins, encountered mystical creatures, and unraveled the forest's mysteries. Along the way, they made friends with talking animals, including a wise old owl, a mischievous squirrel, and a friendly fox.

One day, deep within the forest, they stumbled upon a glimmering waterfall that cascaded into a crystal-clear pond. Alice dipped her hand into the water and felt a surge of energy, as if the very essence of the forest was flowing through her veins. It was then that she realized her true purpose: to protect and preserve the enchanted forest and its magical inhabitants.

With Luna by her side and the support of her newfound friends, Alice dedicated herself to ensuring the forest's well-being. They became its guardians, nurturing the magic and the wonders it held, all the while cherishing the profound connection they had formed.

And so, the enchanting tale of Alice, Luna, and the enchanted forest became a legend, passed down through generations, reminding all who heard it of the beauty and magic that lies within the heart of nature.

Title: "The Chronicles of Elaria"

In the land of Elaria, a realm filled with magic and wonder, where the forests whispered secrets to the wind and the rivers sang songs of old, there was a young sorcerer named Alaric. He was destined for greatness, though he was yet to discover the full extent of his powers.

Elaria was a land where ancient dragons soared through the skies, their scales glistening like precious gemstones. The elves, with their ageless wisdom, inhabited the ancient woods, living in harmony with nature. Dwarves, skilled craftsmen and miners, forged legendary weapons and artifacts deep within the heart of the mountains. The humans, adaptable and diverse, built great cities, fostering trade and knowledge.

Alaric's journey began when he uncovered an old spellbook in the hidden chamber of his family's estate. The spellbook was filled with long-forgotten incantations and arcane knowledge. With each page he turned, his magical abilities grew stronger. He studied the book for years, perfecting his craft.

One day, while practicing a powerful incantation, a portal to another dimension opened before him. Stepping through, Alaric found himself in the Realm of Shadows, a place of eternal twilight and enigmatic beauty. Here, he met the shadow creatures, beings of pure magic, who taught him secrets that no other sorcerer in Elaria had ever known.

Upon his return to Elaria, Alaric was hailed as a hero. His newfound powers allowed him to mend the wounds of the land and bring prosperity to its inhabitants. He used his magic to forge alliances between the different races, fostering peace and cooperation in Elaria. Together, they built an empire that spanned the entire realm.

Yet, peace was not to last. A dark force, known as the Voidseeker, began to encroach upon Elaria. It sought to consume the world's magic, plunging it into darkness. Alaric, now a master sorcerer, led a group of brave warriors on a perilous quest to defeat the Voidseeker.

Their journey took them through treacherous forests, across perilous mountains, and into the heart of the Voidseeker's lair. Battles were fought, sacrifices were made, and Alaric's powers were put to the ultimate test.

In the end, Alaric faced the Voidseeker in a climactic battle. With the strength of his allies and the knowledge he had gained in the Realm of Shadows, he unleashed a spell of blinding light, banishing the Voidseeker and restoring Elaria to a state of tranquility.

And so, Alaric's name became legend in Elaria, a symbol of hope and courage. He continued to protect the realm, ensuring that its magic would thrive for generations to come. The land of Elaria remained a place of wonder, where magic, courage, and unity combined to create a realm unlike any other.

A Big Long Paragraph That None of Us Edit

A week ago a friend invited a couple of other couples over for dinner. Eventually, the food (but not the wine) was cleared off the table for what turned out to be some fierce Scrabbling. Heeding the strategy of going for the shorter, more valuable word over the longer cheaper word, our final play was “Bon,” which–as luck would have it!–happens to be a Japanese Buddhist festival, and not, as I had originally asserted while laying the tiles on the board, one half of a chocolate-covered cherry treat. Anyway, the strategy worked. My team only lost by 53 points instead of 58.

Just the day before, our host had written of the challenges of writing short. In journalism–my friend’s chosen trade, and mostly my own, too–Mark Twain’s observation undoubtedly applies: “I didn’t have time to write a short letter, so I wrote a long one instead.” The principle holds across genres, in letters, reporting, and other writing. It’s harder to be concise than to blather. (Full disclosure, this blog post will clock in at a blather-esque 803 words.) Good writing is boiled down, not baked full of air like a souffl??. No matter how yummy souffl??s may be. Which they are. Yummy like a Grisham novel.

Lately, I’ve been noticing how my sentences have a tendency to keep going when I write them onscreen. This goes for concentrated writing as well as correspondence. (Twain probably believed that correspondence, in an ideal world, also demands concentration. But he never used email.) Last week I caught myself packing four conjunctions into a three-line sentence in an email. That’s inexcusable. Since then, I have tried to eschew conjunctions whenever possible. Gone are the commas, the and’s, but’s, and so’s; in are staccato declaratives. Better to read like bad Hemingway than bad Faulkner.

Length–as we all know, and for lack of a more original or effective way of saying it–matters. But (ahem), it’s also a matter of how you use it. Style and length are technically two different things.

Try putting some prose onscreen, though, and they mix themselves up pretty quickly. This has much to do with the time constraints we claim to feel in the digital age. We don’t have time to compose letters and post them anymore–much less pay postage, what with all the banks kinda-sorta losing our money these days–so we blast a few emails. We don’t have time to talk, so we text. We don’t have time to text to specific people, so we update our Facebook status. We don’t have time to write essays, so we blog.

I’m less interested by the superficial reduction of words–i.e. the always charming imho or c u l8r–than the genres in which those communications occur: blogs, texts, tweets, emails. All these interstitial communiques, do they really reflect super brevity that would make Twain proud? Or do they just reflect poorly stylized writing that desperately seeks a clearer form?

I rather think the latter. Clive Thompson wrote last month in the NYT Magazine that constant digital updates, after a day, can begin “to feel like a short story; follow it for a month, and it’s a novel.” He was right to see the bits as part of a larger whole. The words now flying through our digital pipes & ether more or less tend to resemble parts of bigger units, perhaps even familiar genres. But stories and novels have definite conclusions; they also have conventional lengths. Quick, how long is the conventional blog, when you add up all of its posts and comments? How long is the longest email thread you send back and forth on a single topic?

Most important: What exactly are we writing when we’re doing all of this writing? I won’t pretend to coin a whole new term here; I still think the best we can muster is a more fitting analogue. And if we must find an analogue in an existing literary unit, I propose the paragraph. Our constant writing has begun to feel like a neverending digital paragraph. Not a tight, stabbing paragraph from The Sun Also Rises or even a graceful, sometimes-slinking, sometimes-soaring paragraph from Absalom! Absalom!, I mean a convoluted, haphazard, meandering paragraph, something like Kerouac’s original draft of On the Road–only taped together by bytes. And 1 percent as interesting.

Paragraphs, particularly those that wrap from one page to the next, inherently possess a necessary suspension that tightens the reader’s focus yet breaks down the narrative into digestable sections. Just like emails or blogs or texts. The mental questions while reading all of these feel the same:

“Is this the last line or is there more?”

“Is the writer really trying to say something here, or just setting up a larger point?”

“Does this part have the information I’m looking for?”

(“Can I skip ahead?”)
